- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on MR image reconstruction with machine learning. I'm developing a library, called **[spreco](https://pypi.org/project/spreco/)** based on TensorFlow, for training generative models. With that, I have trained many medical image priors that are hosted on this **[huggingface page](https://huggingface.co/Guanxiong/MRI-Image-Priors)** and used them for image reconstruction. Many of my projects are listed on my [homepage](https://ggluo.github.io). There are some examples on Colab. Give it a try with them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Sample the posterior <br>
