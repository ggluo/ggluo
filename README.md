- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on MR image reconstruction with machine learning. I'm developing a library, called **[spreco](https://pypi.org/project/spreco/)** based on TensorFlow, for training generative models. With that, I have trained many medical image priors that are hosted on this **[huggingface page](https://huggingface.co/Guanxiong/MRI-Image-Priors)** and used them for image reconstruction. Give a quick tryout with [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ggluo/image-priors/blob/release/misc/demo_sampler_colab.ipynb). Many of my projects are listed on my [homepage](https://ggluo.github.io).
